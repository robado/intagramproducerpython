# Instagram App that gets API
This is my try to make an app that gets Instagram API using Python for this. I have made some time ago an app that 
got Instagram API but now I want to do it with Python and in my opinion this will be a good practise to learn some 
Python.

# What I want this to do?
Still not sure will I make the authorization in this app or this will get the token that is needed from somewhere 
else but I will put it here as to do

* Authorization (maybe)
* Make connection to API
* Print the API data
* Send API data to database
