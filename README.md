# Instagram App that gets API
This is my try to make an app that gets Instagram API using Python for this. I have made some time ago an app that 
got Instagram API but now I want to do it with Python and in my opinion this will be a good practise to learn some 
Python.

# What I want this to do?
Still not sure will I make the authorization in this app or this will get the token that is needed from somewhere 
else but I will put it here as to do

* Authorization (maybe)
* Make a http request to API endpoint
    * Now it can get users data only
* Print the API data
* Send API data to database

# How to run this
I'm using **PyCharm** doing this so it is easier to test it but not necessary  
First clone this project   
`git clone https://github.com/robado/intagramproducerpython.git`  

After cloning insert your Instagram token in **instagramproducer.py** folder and then run it. There are two ways to 
run it. One is through terminal by going to the root directory and typing 
`python instagramproducer.py`  

Second way is right clicking the 
**instagramproducer.py** in PyCharm and run
